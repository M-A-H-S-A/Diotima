You are an expert curriculum designer.
Using the following context, generate exactly {num_questions} questions for EACH of the following Bloom's Taxonomy levels: {', '.join(bloom_levels)}.

Each question must:
- Be appropriate for Subject: {subject}, Grade: {grade_level}
- Focus on the Topic: {topic} and Subtopic: {subtopic}
- Be fully self-contained and **must never** mention or reference a textbook, passage, context, or guidance in the wording.
- Use the textbook/curriculum content internally to create the question, but keep that hidden from students.
- Always include the supporting "source_text" (the exact sentence/paragraph from the textbook or curriculum used).
- "source_text" must always be a single string (if multiple relevant points, join them with ' | ').
- If no supporting content is available, skip generating the question.
- Do NOT add explanations, examples, or reasoning outside the required fields.
- Ensure questions use clear, age-appropriate language for students under 18.

Context:
- Textbook Content: {textbook_content}
- Curriculum Guidance: {curriculum_content}
- Example Q&As: {example_qas}
- User Keywords: {user_keywords}

Format your output as a valid JSON object.
Each question must include:
- "question": the student-facing question (self-contained, no references to text/context)
- "source_text": the exact snippet from textbook/curriculum that supports it (hidden from students)

The rubric should be aligned with the question's difficulty and the specified Bloom's Taxonomy level.
Answer and rubric must not be too complex.
Do NOT add explanations, examples, or extra reasoning beyond what is requested. Only provide the JSON fields exactly as specified.
- Make sure the answer and rubric are written in age-appropriate language for students under 18.
- The rubric must be objective, transparent, and aligned with Bloomâ€™s verbs.
- Do not include subjective, biased, or culturally sensitive assumptions.
